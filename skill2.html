    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <p>Problem-solving skills are the ability to identify problems, brainstorm and analyze answers, and implement the best solutions. An employee with good problem-solving skills is both a self-starter and a collaborative teammate; they are proactive in understanding the root of a problem and work with others to consider a wide range of solutions before deciding how to move forward. 

        Examples of using problem-solving skills in the workplace include:
        
        Researching patterns to understand why revenue decreased last quarter
        Experimenting with a new marketing channel to increase website sign-ups
        Brainstorming content types to share with potential customers
        Testing calls to action to see which ones drive the most product sales
        Implementing a new workflow to automate a team process and increase productivity</p>
